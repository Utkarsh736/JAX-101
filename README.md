# JAX-101: Journey Through JAX in 101 Days

Welcome to JAX-101, where I document my adventure of learning and implementing JAX from scratch over 101 consecutive days! This repository serves as both a learning journal and a comprehensive guide for others diving into JAX.

## 🎯 The Challenge

Commit to learning and implementing something new in JAX every single day for 101 days, starting from basic operations to building and training neural networks. Each day's work will be documented with code, explanations, and insights gained along the way.

## 🗺️ Learning Path

The journey is structured into progressive phases:

### Phase 1: Foundations 
* Basic JAX operations and transformations
* Understanding `jit`, `vmap`, and `grad`
* Array manipulations and mathematical operations
* Key differences from NumPy

### Phase 2: Core Concepts 
* Random number generation with PRNG keys
* JAX transformations in depth
* Automatic differentiation
* Function transformations and composability

### Phase 3: Neural Network Basics 
* Building basic layers from scratch
* Implementing activation functions
* Forward and backward propagation
* Parameter management

### Phase 4: Advanced Topics 
* Custom gradients and optimization
* JAX-based neural network library
* Batch processing and data handling
* Advanced JAX transformations

### Phase 5: Projects & Applications
* Complete ML models implementation
* Performance optimization
* Real-world applications
* Comparative analysis with other frameworks
